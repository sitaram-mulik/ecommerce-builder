# One time steps to setup the application:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npx lerna bootstrap`

# Use any of the below commands to run the application 
`npm start` - To run the application for demo purpose

- This will build the ui code and serve it on the backend server

`npm run dev` - To run the application in developement mode

- It spins up the backend and ui servers in development mode(enables hot reloding)
